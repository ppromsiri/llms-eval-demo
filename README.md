# LLMs Evaluation Demo

This project demonstrates how to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) using Phoenix for tracking experiments and metrics. It focuses on evaluating character roleplay performance and other metrics for different RPG characters.

## Project Overview

This demo showcases:
- Character-based LLM agents (default novice adventurer and arcane mage)
- Evaluation of responses using LLM-as-judge approaches
- Integration with Phoenix for experiment tracking
- Datasets of example character interactions

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Poetry for dependency management
- Phoenix server running locally for experiment tracking

## Installing Poetry

If you don't have Poetry installed, follow these instructions based on your operating system:

### macOS / Linux

Install with the official installer:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

After installation, you may need to add Poetry to your PATH. Add this line to your shell configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Windows

#### Using PowerShell

```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -
```

After installation, Poetry should be automatically added to your PATH. If not, you may need to add `%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts` to your system PATH.

#### Using Chocolatey

If you have Chocolatey package manager:

```
choco install poetry
```

### Verifying Installation

To verify that Poetry is installed correctly:

```bash
poetry --version
```

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
# Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/BigDataRPG/llms-eval-demo.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd llms-eval-demo
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example:

```bash
# Copy the example env file
cp .env.example .env

# Open the file and add your Gemini API key
# On macOS/Linux
nano .env
# OR on Windows
notepad .env
```

Add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file:
```
gemini_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

You can get a Gemini API key from the Google AI Studio at https://aistudio.google.com/

### 3. Set Up Python Environment with Poetry

Configure Poetry to create virtualenvs in the project directory:

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Install project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

This might take a few minutes as Poetry resolves and installs all required packages.

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate

# On Windows (PowerShell)
& $(poetry env info --path)\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# On Windows (CMD)
call $(poetry env info --path)\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### 5. Set Python Path

This ensures Python can find the modules in the project:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/src

# On Windows (PowerShell)
$env:PYTHONPATH += ";$(pwd)\src"

# On Windows (CMD)
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;%cd%\src
```

## Running the Demo

### Start Phoenix Server

```bash
phoenix start
```

This will start the Phoenix server on http://localhost:6006

### Run Character Demos

To test the character agents and see their responses:

```bash
python src/agentic/agents/run_agent.py
```

### Create Evaluation Datasets

If you need to upload datasets to Phoenix:

```bash
python src/agentic/evaluators/add_dataset.py
```

### Run Evaluations

To run evaluations using LLM judges:

```bash
python src/agentic/evaluations/run_evaluation_llm.py
```

## Project Components

### Character Agents

- Default Novice Adventurer: A basic level 1 RPG character with limited skills
- Arcane Mage: A powerful level 12 magic user with various spells

### Evaluation Methods

The project demonstrates two evaluation approaches:
1. LLM-as-judge: Using another LLM to evaluate roleplay quality
2. Conciseness evaluation: Measuring how efficient the responses are

### Phoenix Integration

All evaluations are tracked in Phoenix for easy visualization and comparison between models and prompts.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Poetry not found**: Make sure Poetry is properly installed and added to your PATH
- **Python version mismatch**: Ensure you have Python 3.12+ installed
- **Phoenix server connection issues**: Verify the Phoenix server is running at http://localhost:6006
- **Module not found errors**: Check that your PYTHONPATH is set correctly
- **API key issues**: Verify your Gemini API key is correctly set in the .env file
- **Dependency errors**: Try `poetry update` to update dependencies to compatible versions
